# Iqraa (إقرأ) - The Digital Rihal

**Preserving the Legacy of Islamic Knowledge Through Modern Technology.**

Welcome to **Iqraa**, a unified Learning Management System (LMS) dedicated to the serious student of knowledge (_Talib al-Ilm_). Unlike generic PDF readers or fragmented video playlists, Iqraa creates a structured, interactive, and community-driven environment for mastering Classical Islamic Texts (_Mutuun_).

## 📖 What is Iqraa?

For centuries, students have used the **Rihal** (bookstand) to support their study of sacred texts. Iqraa is the **Digital Rihal**.

We bridge the gap between the traditional methodology of learning—focusing on **Memorization (Hifdh)**, **Comprehension (Fahm)**, and **Curriculum (Manhaj)**—and the convenience of modern software.
